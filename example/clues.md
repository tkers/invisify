### Part 1 --- The Manor

Your first goal should be investigating the crime scene and understanding
what has happened. That means finding the body that was reported,
examining it, and investigating the rest of the manor.

**How do I get into the manor?**

- Reach the front door by going North
- Have you asked the sarge about the door?
- Simply knock on the front door
